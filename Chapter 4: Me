To give some backstory of how I got here, I feel like I have to explain the torment I experienced as a child raised by a cluster of sociopaths. 
I know that’s a word that a lot of people like to throw around, so I’d like to briefly explain what it actually means. 

Narcissists (hell, all of us) are on a spectrum. 

Not all narcissists are sociopaths, but all sociopaths are narcissists because sociopaths are on the more extreme end of the scale.

My relatives resemble a cult that functions quite a lot like Scientology does (Fair-Gaming, in particular).
One of the few fortunate things about sociopaths and narcissists, the various methods and manipulation tactics are all the same. 
(Someone does NOT have to be on the narcissistic spectrum to have these traits or use these tactics, but if they are they will ONLY use
these tactics when it comes to interpersonal relationships as it is a knee-jerk reaction and they don’t know any other way). 

They are not creative or unique, they’re just fucked up. 
Even breathing wrong could result in a meltdown, so I have been hypervigilent and hyperaware since birth. 
This provided me a sort of super-power, to me micro-expressions are LOUD. 
If the conversation is two steps away from going south, I can spot it and redirect. 
I also attribute my synesthesia to this, as I had to learn things quickly or starve or be abused. 
Many hacker stories are like this. It's like taking something beautiful with us out of the struggle. 
It's like having something to show for it. 

This has made me a great people person, but this has also left me with CPTSD, which comes with depression, panic and (private) outbursts. 
Which is why I go to Trauma Therapy (Somatic Experiencing/EMDR) once a week and practice yoga, mediation and music daily. 
It's hard work keeping your shit together. I'm here to teach. 

If you familiarize yourself with a few key phrases and learn how to identify them in the moment, their powers will no longer work on you. 

These are not the droids you’re looking for. 

Scape-Goating - shunning or otherwise undermining a specific individual, who has either not fallen in line or submitted fully they way they were expected to, 
stood up for themselves in some way or is simply someone easy and fun for them to fuck with.

Part 2 how I got hacked 


Before I knew any of this (unfortunately), I walked into the hornet’s nest naked. I’d been a tech-geek since I could walk but when I discovered 
hacking and the hacker community it just hit different. 

I wanted to know everything about everything so that I could use those powers in a creative way no one had ever thought of before to 
make the world a better place and help prevent as much suffering as I could while I was alive. 

“It’s not difficult to decide what you want your life to be about, what’s difficult is deciding what you’re willing
to give up in order to achieve those things.” 

I gave up everything, my safety, my false sense of security, my body, my self esteem and in the end I gained it all: 
my sense of self and my purpose. 
I would do it all again. 

I discovered Corpse Husband, a YouTuber who had made some videos on the “Dark Web.” I’d heard of it but never really dabbled, 
I liked the idea that it was difficult to get to: the underground. 

Corpse said explicitly, over and over and over again to not go to the Dark Web because it was dangerous and it could get you killed. 

It’s not that I wanted this to happen, it’s just that I didn’t really give a fuck if it did. 
Death was better than never knowing, and so was born my way of life. 

Death is always better than not knowing, right up until the moment the answer you get makes you beg for it. 

I started so green and so frustrated as to why no one was doing anything if apparently we had all this power to make change. 

I learned the hard lesson that it's a lot more difficult than it looks, just ask Bernie Sanders who literally had a heart attack trying to tell us 
that the mega-rich don't pay taxes.

I was hacked by two groups of people at the same time. Both were extremely abusive in their own ways, 
I really got it from all angles at the same time, it was brutal. That's pretty much all the detail I can give. 

It was extremely difficult and took every ounce of me to get out of that situation alone. I weighed 86lbs by the time the whole thing was over. 

But it is over, I fucking did that shit and you can too. 


The Laughing Heart by Charles Bukowski

your life is your life
don’t let it be clubbed into dank submission.
be on the watch.
there are ways out.
there is light somewhere.
it may not be much light but
it beats the darkness.
be on the watch.
the gods will offer you chances.
know them.
take them.
you can’t beat death but
you can beat death in life, sometimes.
and the more often you learn to do it,
the more light there will be.
your life is your life.
know it while you have it.
you are marvelous
the gods wait to delight
in you.
